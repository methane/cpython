# JIT bug-remediation plan

Updated: 2026-09-16

## Scope

Fix and verify every actionable item in `bugs_report.md` on
`codex/method-jit`, starting from `d95f29589e03603aa13d8ca9d4f817dce77d357c`.
Keep all work local: no GitHub posts, pushes, or pull-request changes.  Builds
use the installed LLVM 21 and omit PGO and LTO.

## Progress

- Completed M-1 through M-4: corrected dict receiver guards, builtins and
  globals identity guards, and short-loop retry countdown selection.
- Diagnosed M-5: the apparent linear growth is the bounded executor deletion
  queue.  A 25-batch run showed periodic drops at the 1000-executor cleanup
  threshold, so no runtime change is warranted.
- Completed M-6 through M-10: numeric replica ordering, complete stencil and
  recorder dependencies, the recorder default path, and reviewed non-escaping
  API classifications.
- Completed M-11 and M-12 in the assembly optimizer: local references from
  instructions and preserved data now keep constant pools and jump-table case
  blocks live.
- Completed P-1 and P-2: inherited method descriptors accept compatible
  subclasses, and folded globals use per-name value dependencies while keys
  structure and namespace identity remain guarded.
- Regenerated all affected checked-in cases from their source definitions.
- Completed native LLVM 21 stencil generation and release JIT builds with
  ordinary compiler flags.  A normal incremental `make` detected the optimizer
  header change, regenerated stencils, rebuilt `optimizer.o`, and relinked the
  executable.

## Design decisions

- Globals identity stays separate from the keys version because copied dicts
  can share keys while holding different values.
- Globals dependencies distinguish value replacement from structural mutation.
  Bloom-filter collisions may conservatively invalidate but cannot preserve an
  invalid executor.
- Stencil reachability scans known assembler labels instead of recognizing a
  target-specific jump-table syntax.  This also covers compiler-created
  constant pools.
- M-5 retains the existing delayed deletion protocol because immediate freeing
  would risk releasing machine code still active on another thread.

## Validation

- Fresh Tier-2 debug interpreter build: success.
- Fresh native JIT release build: success.  Its configure arguments contain
  `--enable-experimental-jit=yes` without PGO or LTO.
- Native executor probe: `sys._jit.is_available()` and
  `sys._jit.is_enabled()` are true, and `get_jit_code()` returned 4096 bytes.
- Native `test_optimizer test_capi.test_opt`, with JIT disabled: 327 run,
  3 skipped, success.
- Native `test_optimizer test_capi.test_opt`, with `PYTHON_JIT=1`: 327 run,
  3 skipped, success.  The final run used the final rebuilt executable.
- Tier-2 debug `PYTHON_JIT=1 test_capi.test_opt`: 319 run, 3 skipped,
  success.
- `test_generated_cases test_tools.test_jit`: 104 run, success.
- Namespace lifetime and non-string equivalent-key globals cases: success.
- Full LLVM 21 x86-64 stencil generation with ordinary flags: success after the
  reachability fix.  The focused fixture reproduced the latent constant-pool
  and jump-table deletion before the fix and passes after it.
- All affected generators were rerun.  A second regeneration preserved the
  SHA-256 hashes of every checked artifact.
- Python sources compile, the new standalone test file passes Ruff, and
  `git diff --check` passes.
- No PGO or LTO was used.

Native evidence identity:

- HEAD: `d95f29589e03603aa13d8ca9d4f817dce77d357c`
- HEAD tree: `b4962cb04902e6fe831959b47784e91214f68f32`
- Tracked working-tree diff SHA-256:
  `8d134b3de7ccc5b2f808f342568fc2954a103d520db13a147f23ebd82805d3bf`
- Native executable SHA-256:
  `69fb7ca0fbf0fbb100e7f6a65d6bde270c0ede73c502b8f94f3d1368ed8a0621`
- The working tree is dirty with the remediation changes; the new JIT tool
  test is still untracked and has SHA-256
  `d04480a1c10b222dc92a4f27f719845529f3c475c8852cb56289ec3db31521dc`.

## Next work

All bug-remediation work in this plan is complete.  The implementation,
regression tests, and reports are included in the same local changeset.  No
GitHub post, push, or pull-request change has been made.

The AGENTS.md command naming `test_tier3` cannot run on this revision because
that module is absent; `test_optimizer` is the current corresponding module.
`make patchcheck` also cannot determine the base branch because this checkout's
CPython remote has no discoverable default branch.  Its substantive whitespace
and syntax checks were run directly instead.

# PEP 836 method-JIT and free-threading plan

Updated: 2026-09-16

## Scope

Replace runtime path recording with a method-oriented frontend while retaining
the existing uop optimizer and copy-and-patch backend.  Make the resulting JIT
usable in a `--disable-gil` build.  Preserve the completed bug fixes above,
keep all work local, and build with LLVM 21 without PGO or LTO.

## Progress

- Read PEP 836 and mapped its frontend, middle-end, and free-threading goals to
  the current tree.
- Confirmed that current `main` has no method frontend: it records one executed
  path and turns conditional branches into guards and side exits.
- Located the free-threading blockers: `_PyOptimizer_Optimize()` returns early,
  executor insertion assumes the main bytecode array, reverse function/type
  caches are disabled, tests are skipped, and configure emits a warning.
- Reviewed the PEP author's public `method_jit` prototypes.  They predate the
  current recording frontend and are not the newer proof of concept described
  by PEP 836, so their code cannot be applied directly.
- Reviewed the public free-threaded JIT implementation.  Its first safe stage
  runs the JIT while an interpreter has one thread, atomically disables it and
  invalidates executors before a second thread runs, and re-enables it after
  returning to one thread.  This is the initial concurrency policy used here.
- Implemented a method-entry frontend.  It decodes the complete bytecode into
  basic blocks, discovers reachable blocks with a worklist, emits direct uop
  edges for conditional branches, jumps, and iterator exhaustion, and installs
  one executor at the entry `RESUME`.
- Kept the runtime recorder as a compatibility frontend for backedges and for
  methods outside the first supported subset.  The method frontend currently
  rejects generators, coroutines, exception tables, oversized methods, and
  Python-call inlining; an unsupported instruction exits explicitly to Tier 1.
- Regenerated all opcode and uop cases after adding the method control-flow
  uops.  Stack-cache allocation now records input-to-output offsets so direct
  CFG edges remain correct after inserted spill/reload operations.
- Enabled Tier 2 in a free-threaded build.  The JIT gate is atomic, reverse
  function/type caches use their existing locks, and executor insertion and
  restoration account for thread-local bytecode.
- Made executor validity atomic.  This is the synchronization point used when
  thread creation disables JIT execution and invalidates installed executors.
- Completed an LLVM 21 native JIT build with `--disable-gil`.  Method-sized
  branch and range executors both compile through the copy-and-patch backend.

## Design decisions

- The first free-threaded implementation preserves thread-local bytecode.  Its
  index 0 is the code object's main bytecode and is used while only one thread
  exists; later thread-local copies restore an `ENTER_EXECUTOR` to its original
  opcode when copied.
- Creating a thread state stops the target interpreter before publishing the
  new state.  JIT disablement, executor invalidation, code detachment, and exit
  table updates happen while the existing interpreter threads are stopped.
  This closes the transition race where a native executor could otherwise be
  modified while its first thread was still executing it.
- Function/type reverse caches are maintained under their existing locks in a
  free-threaded Tier-2 build.  The optimizer reads them only while JIT execution
  is restricted to the sole interpreter thread.
- Backward jumps and eligible method-entry `RESUME` instructions retain a
  dynamically gated JIT check in a free-threaded build.  Their hotness counters
  pause while a second thread exists, so temporary suspension cannot permanently
  prevent recompilation after the interpreter returns to one thread.
- The tracing recorder's strong reference to a range iterator is discounted
  only when it accounts for every reference beyond the active frame's reference.
  This preserves the free-threading ownership rule while allowing the existing
  range specialization to run during trace construction.
- Method compilation will be attached to the method entry and will select the
  full code object as its compilation unit.  Unsupported blocks will leave an
  explicit exit to Tier 1 rather than falling back to runtime trace recording.
- Method CFG construction and uop optimization remain separate so control-flow
  merge handling can be tested independently.
- Method CFG edges use an empty stack-cache signature.  Every predecessor
  spills before its edge, so a block has the same Python value-stack convention
  regardless of which predecessor reached it.
- Returns currently deopt immediately before `RETURN_VALUE`.  This lets Tier 1
  restore either an interpreter caller or a caller with Tier 2 cached state.
  Straight-line functions remain with the trace frontend until method returns
  can restore both caller forms without losing cross-call specialization.
- The existing linear symbolic optimizer is not run over a method CFG yet; it
  requires explicit merge-state handling first.  Specialized bytecode still
  expands to specialized uops, and the copy-and-patch backend consumes the same
  executor representation.

## Validation

- Fresh `--disable-gil --with-pydebug --enable-experimental-jit=interpreter`
  build: success, without PGO or LTO.
- Free-threaded runtime lifecycle probe: JIT enabled with one thread, disabled
  while a second thread was live, and re-enabled after it exited.
- Free-threaded `PYTHON_JIT=1 test_capi.test_opt`: 324 run, 3 skipped,
  success.  The three former class-wide free-threading skips were removed.
- Added a regression test covering executor invalidation, suppression of
  compilation while two threads are live, and recompilation after returning to
  one thread.
- Added method tests proving that an unexecuted conditional arm is present in
  the compiled CFG and that a specialized range loop follows direct method
  edges.  Both tests execute alternate inputs after compilation.
- A free-threaded debug probe compiled entry executors for a conditional loop
  and a range loop, then produced correct results for values that exercise all
  branches.  Direct Python callers remain correct because returns deopt before
  frame teardown.
- The generic method iterator error path now emits a declared uop error edge;
  generated metadata and handlers therefore distinguish exhaustion from an
  exception.
- Final free-threaded and GIL debug regression runs each passed
  `test_capi.test_opt`, `test_optimizer`, `test_generated_cases`, and
  `test_tools.test_jit`: 435 tests run, with 3 and 4 skips respectively.
- The free-threaded native LLVM 21 build passed the same 435 tests, plus all
  245 `test_threading` tests and 17 focused free-threading code, function, and
  thread-state tests.
- The native branch method produced 4096 bytes of machine code and correctly
  executed both arms, including the arm not used during warmup.  The native
  range method produced 8192 bytes, was invalidated while a second thread was
  live, and was regenerated as a distinct 8192-byte executor after that thread
  exited.  A 25-cycle invalidate/recompile stress probe also passed.
- `make regen-cases` was run with `/usr/bin/python3.12`; all 11 generated-file
  SHA-256 values matched the pre-regen snapshot.  `git diff --check` passed.
- The host's user-installed Python 3.13.11 intermittently failed to reap short
  asyncio LLVM subprocesses.  Stencil generation used `/usr/bin/python3.12`
  with `/usr/lib/llvm-21`; no source workaround, PGO, or LTO was used.
- `method_jit_status.md` records the final implementation boundary, supported
  subset, validation matrix, and remaining work for this local snapshot.

## Next work

Add merge-aware symbolic optimization so type and constant facts can flow
through the method CFG.  Then replace the current Tier-1 return deopt with a
method return protocol that preserves cached state for both Tier-1 and Tier-2
callers.  Those pieces are prerequisites for enabling straight-line methods,
Python-call inlining, exception-table regions, and performance evaluation of a
broader method-JIT subset.
