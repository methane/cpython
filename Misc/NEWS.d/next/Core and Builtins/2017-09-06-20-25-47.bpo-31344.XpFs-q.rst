For finer control of tracing behaviour when testing the interpreter, two new
frame attributes have been added to control the emission of particular trace
events: ``f_trace_lines`` (``True`` by default) to turn off per-line trace
events; and ``f_trace_opcodes`` (``False`` by default) to turn on per-opcode
trace events.
